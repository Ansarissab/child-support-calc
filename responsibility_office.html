<h1 style="margin-top:5rem">How the Ontario Family Responsibility Office Works</h1>
<p>The Ontario Family Responsibility Office is mandated through the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services.  Under the Family Responsibility and Support Arrears Enforcement Act (1996), the office is tasked with doing everything they legally can to enforce payors in support orders to make their payments to recipients.  This situation can apply to child support orders as well as spousal support situations.
</p><p>
When payors fail to make any of the payments on these registered orders, the Family Responsibility Office can then move to the enforcement stage of collecting for the recipients.   The office does not in any way determine the amount of support to be paid, nor does it change the wording and interpretation of any orders or get involved in access or custodial issues involving children.
</p><p>
When the Ontario Family Responsibility Office received an endorsed order, it will assign a case number and give each person involved a pin number and enclose it with their case number.  When the office received a support payment, it usually will turn over funds to the recipient within a 48 hour period.  People who are involved in an agreement registered with the Ontario Family Responsibility Office are required to notify the office of a change in address or other certain circumstances.
