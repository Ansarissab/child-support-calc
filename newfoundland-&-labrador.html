    <p/>Use the Newfoundland and Labrador child support calculator to determine the potential basic monthly payments that may need to be made in a family court action. Newfoundland and Labrador adopted the Federal Child Support Guidelines through its Family Law Act, albeit with a few minor amendments that may vary the monthly amounts paid.
    <p/>It is imperative that residents of Newfoundland and Labrador be aware that certain courts in certain areas do not accept filings of documents related to child support matters. You must contact the local courts administration office in your area to determine where that information is to go, and where you might be able to obtain information about child support court matters. The Family Court section of the Newfoundland and Labrador Courts website has excellent informative resources for those involved in a Newfoundland and Labrador child support action. Readers should also visit the Newfoundland and Labrador Family Court website, where they will find significant amounts of user-friendly information.
