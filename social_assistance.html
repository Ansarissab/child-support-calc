<h1 style="margin-top:5rem">Social Assistance Benefits and Child Support</h1>

<p>Social assistance benefits are designed to assist those who are in a position of significant financial hardship.  A person may have no source of employment or may face a shortfall requiring them to seek benefits to help them pay their basic expenses.  When someone is applying for social assistance benefits, they must be able to declare all of their sources of money earned.  That money earned has to be taken into consideration as part of the completed application.

Parents who are recipients of child support as part of a court action, but perhaps are facing a shortfall must do everything they can to first obtain as much child support as they can before even applying for social assistance benefits.  If they fail to do so, it can result in significant delays in their application for benefits which may unduly cause them further financial hardship.

Parents who are applying for social assistance benefits and are already in receipt of child support may have that amount deducted from their total eligibility once it is determined.  Depending on where you live, you should find out if there is a requirement that a paying parent cannot pay less than a set amount in whatever guidelines might apply to your situation.
