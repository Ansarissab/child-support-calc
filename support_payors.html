<h1 style="margin-top:5rem">Information for Support Payors in Ontario</h1>
<p>In Ontario, a support payor is defined as someone who is required to pay support as a result of an action in family law court.  This could include child support as well as spousal support.  A payor may be required to start paying support effective the date they may no longer be residing with their children on a full-time basis.  In a court order, a payor could start making support payments on the date stated in the court order.
</p><p>
If an order gets registered with the Family Responsibility Office, the payor must remit those support payments through that office and not send them directly to the recipient.  If for whatever reason circumstances of a support payor change, they are required to return to court to seek an amendment to the support order.  The Family Responsibility Office is still required to use whatever means they require under their mandate to continue collection of those support payments from payors.  Some exceptions apparently can be made based on circumstances.  In those cases the office can work out a payment schedule allowing a payor to pay any back-support owing in combination with current support payments. 
</p><p>
If payments of support fall far behind, the Ontario Family Responsibility Office can after so many days report the non-payment of support to the proper credit desk.  Payors who fall behind may risk being able to obtain any credit in the future.  In a few cases, the office can take steps to suspend a payor’s driver’s license.
