<p>The Family Responsibility Office in Ontario is an arm’s length branch of the government with a mandate to enforce support payment orders in family court.  Its’ mandate falls under the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services.  When an Ontario court issues a support order formally endorsed by a judge, that order can then be registered with the Family Responsibility Office.  Once the process of registering that order is complete, the Family Responsibility Office then can proceed with enforcement of that order by whatever legal means they have at their disposal.

Ontario’s Courts have prepared Ontario Family Responsibility Office information packages for those who are going to register orders with them.  Like all other court information brochures, these information packages are updated on a regular basis as procedures change within the system.  By providing users with the most up to date information available, the Family Responsibility Office of Ontario ensures a streamlined approach for all users and stakeholders.
