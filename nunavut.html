    <p/><img src="/res/img/misc/Nunavut_Flag.jpg" alt="Nunavut Flag" style="margin-right:20px;margin-bottom:20px;float:left">There is almost no information available online regarding child support claims in Nunavut. Indeed, there appear to be very limited resources available to assist claimants in bringing or enforcing their claims. This is perhaps unsurprising given the small population of the Territory, however should you identify a resource in this area we would love to hear about it - please email us at <a href="mailto:admin@childsupportcalculator.ca">admin@childsupportcalculator.ca</a>.
    <p/><span style="font-style:italic"></span>We strongly recommend that you contact a family lawyer who practices in Nunavut for more information on bringing a child support claim in the Territory of Nunavut.
