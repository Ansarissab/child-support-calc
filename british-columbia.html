The BC child support calculator will then provide an amount of child support potentially payable by the paying parent.

    <p/>The courts of British Columbia have specific rules set out for how one can apply for child support based on relationship status of the parents.  If you are the person applying for the child support, you should consult courts administration at the Supreme Court of British Columbia or the British Columbia Provincial Court, Family Division for further information.  It is important that you know what, where and how you go about applying for child support and that it is through the right level of court.
    <p/>If the amount of child support to be paid is too high, then the paying parent must prove that there is a financial hardship preventing them from paying that amount.  The amount calculated by the BC Child support calculator may not be the amount the paying parent can afford to pay.  Any circumstantial evidence of hardship would have to be reviewed by the court and ruled on whether it is in fact hardship on the paying parent.
