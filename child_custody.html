<h1 style="margin-top:5rem">Child Custody</h1>

<p>
	Child Custody is the term used to define a legal arrangement where a parent or guardian has responsibility for the care of children.&nbsp;Child custody issues come up before the courts usually in divorce proceedings. Child custody arrangements also can come up when the courts are hearing matters involving child protective services agencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	In divorce proceedings, child custody arrangements are often determined by the court and written into final orders. Judges are supposed to determine what is in the best interests of the children.&nbsp;Often family law trials with child custody issues at the forefront will sometimes become very bitter contests between parents.&nbsp;This is especially prevalent when they are working to present evidence in order to obtain sole custody of their children.&nbsp;</p>

	Joint child custody arrangements are also quite common, particularly when the parents live in close proximity of each other.&nbsp;In these instances a parent might have the child live with them every weekend, or so many days per week and month.&nbsp;Some joint child custody arrangements may have children spending entire summers with the other parent, especially if the other parent lives a significant distance away.</p>
