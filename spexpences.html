<h1 style="margin-top:5rem">Child Support and Special Expenses</h1>
<p>Child support and special expenses will be determined by the court depending on each situation involving children.  Courts may be required to take into consideration expenses ranging from a childâ€™s participation in activities to their post-secondary education.  Medical expenses may also fall under special expenses. 
</p><p>
Each individual case involving child support and special expenses is ruled on by the courts on a one by one basis every time. Parents have to present a significant amount of evidence to prove these special expenses are necessary so a court can make a proper ruling.  In the case of medical expenses, notes and correspondence from a physician along with prescription drug receipts may assist.  This is particular in cases where a child may have an ongoing medical condition to deal with.

Child care expenses may also be taken into consideration as a special expense and may be awarded on top of child support amounts as set out in respective guidelines.  In these instances you may have parents who have to pay for day-care or after-school care as part of the regular routines of the family daily life.
