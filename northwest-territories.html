    <p/>This calculator is for sole custody situations, i.e. where the child lives with one parent at least 40% of the time. For other situations please try this advanced <a href="https://www.mcgurk.ca/child-support-calculator/">child support calculator</a>.
    <p/><img src="/res/img/misc/Northwest_Territories_Flag.jpg" alt="Northwest Territories Flag" style="margin-right:20px;margin-bottom:20px;float:left">Collecting child support in the Northwest Territories can be very difficult. A recent article suggests <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/deadbeats-in-n-w-t-owe-10m-in-child-support-1.2784219">as much as $10 million is owed by non-custodial parents</a> in the NWT. The system is facing challenges. However, if you don't bring a claim you will never collect - regardless of whether the system is reformed or not.
    <p/><span style="font-style:italic">We strongly recommend that you contact a family lawyer practicing in the Northwest Territories before bringing a child support claim. However, some free legal resources should be available at the Supreme Court of The Northwest Territories, in Yellowknife, which you can use to bring your own child support claim.</span>
